## 📝 Problem Statement  
In this assignment, I worked with the following dataset:  

- **Data:** `[5.2, 5.4, 5.1, 5.6, 5.3, 5.8]`  
- **Hypothesized Mean:** `5.5`  

### Tasks:  
1. Calculate the **t-statistic** and **p-value**.  
2. Interpret and visualize the results at a **0.05 significance level**.

## 🎯 What I Learned  
Through this assignment, I gained the following skills and knowledge:  

- ✅ **Performing a one-sample t-test:**  
  I learned how to compare a sample mean to a hypothesized mean using statistical methods.  

- ✅ **Calculating t-statistic and p-value:**  
  Using Python's `scipy.stats` library, I calculated these key metrics to evaluate the hypothesis.  

- ✅ **Interpreting results:**  
  I understood how to interpret the results of a hypothesis test at a given significance level (e.g., 0.05).  

- ✅ **Data visualization:**  
  I used `matplotlib` to create visualizations that compare the data distribution to the hypothesized mean.  

- ✅ **Practical application:**  
  This assignment helped me understand how hypothesis testing is used in real-world data analysis and decision-making.
