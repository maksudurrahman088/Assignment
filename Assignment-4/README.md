## 📝 Problem Statement  
In this assignment, I performed a **two-sample t-test** to determine whether the means of two different normal distributions are significantly different.  

### **Steps Involved:**  
1. **Generate Two Sets of Data**  
   - Sample 1: **50 random values** from a normal distribution with mean **μ1 = 50** and standard deviation **σ1 = 10**.  
   - Sample 2: **50 random values** from a normal distribution with mean **μ2 = 55** and standard deviation **σ2 = 12**.  

2. **Perform a Two-Sample T-Test**  
   - Null Hypothesis (H₀): The means of both distributions are equal.  
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The means of both distributions are different.  

3. **Analyze the Results**  
   - Compute the **t-statistic** and **p-value**.  
   - Compare the p-value with the **significance level (0.05)** to draw conclusions.  

4. **Visualize the Data**  
   - Plot **histograms** for both distributions.  
   - Mark the **mean values** on the graph to compare them.

## 🎯 What I Learned  
Through this assignment, I gained insights into:  

- ✅ **Generating normal distributions in Python:** Using `numpy.random.normal()` to simulate real-world datasets.  
- ✅ **Performing a two-sample t-test:** Using `scipy.stats.ttest_ind()` to compare two independent sample means.  
- ✅ **Interpreting statistical results:** Understanding t-statistic, p-value, and hypothesis testing decisions.  
- ✅ **Data visualization with Matplotlib:** Plotting histograms to compare the distributions graphically.  
- ✅ **Practical application of hypothesis testing:** Learning how hypothesis tests are used in real-world data analysis and decision-making.
