## Assignment Details:

### Tasks:
    1. Vector Plotting:
        -> Generate two vectors with 15 random float values each.
        -> Plot both vectors on the same graph with labeled axes and a title.

    2. Heatmap Visualization:
        -> Create a 4×4 matrix with random values.
        -> Visualize the matrix as a heatmap with proper row and column labels.

    3. Matrix Operations and Visualization:
        -> Generate two 4×4 matrices with random values.
        -> Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication(dot) on them.
        -> Visualize the results using bar plots and discuss the effects.

## Concepts Covered:
- NumPy for random data generation and matrix operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Understanding vector and matrix operations
- Interpreting heatmaps and bar plots for numerical analysis
## What I Learned:
- How to work with NumPy arrays and perform basic mathematical operations.
- How to use Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data visualization.
- The impact of mathematical operations on matrices and how to interpret their results visually.
- The importance of clear labeling in visualizations for better data interpretation.
