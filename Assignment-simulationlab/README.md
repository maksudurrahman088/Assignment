### Problem:
    1. Vector Plotting:
        -> Generate two vectors with 15 random float values each.
        -> Plot both vectors on the same graph with labeled axes and a title.

    2. Heatmap Visualization:
        -> Create a 4×4 matrix with random values.
        -> Visualize the matrix as a heatmap with proper row and column labels.

    3. Matrix Operations and Visualization:
        -> Generate two 4×4 matrices with random values.
        -> Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication(dot) on them.
        -> Visualize the results using bar plots and discuss the effects.
